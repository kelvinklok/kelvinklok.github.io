        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          I led a project with 3 designers to explore new features intended to engage users and excite customers to boost sales. I interviewed executive stakeholders and data scientists to define key objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the manager of a small team that also supported client delivery and business development, I also helped each designer prioritize incoming requests and create the bandwidth for this project.

          <figcaption>TrueChoice’s 3-part Methodology, featuring original UI</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          At TrueChoice, we build web apps that quantify user preferences and allow us to share quantifiable and actionable insights with our customers — most of whom are part of the Fortune Global 500. The HR Optimization app is one of many offerings and helps an organization curate a more desirable Total Rewards package and save costs. It is segmented into 3 parts for each participating employee to learn, compare, and decide. In the end, we recommend the next best actions according to their answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 3-part methodology behind the app has been around since 2006 and the UI has been unchanged for over 12 years, even surviving its translation from Flash to HTML 5 in 2014. Optically, this led to a decline in interest in our product as innovation was not perceived by prospective customers who already knew about or worked with TrueChoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project took place during the COVID-19 pandemic and our teams were completely remote and/or in different time zones. This was also the first time that some of us worked together at this scale due to recent hires and my push for meaningful communication and cross-team collaboration.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          The CEO asked us to introduce “personalization” and “conversational vibes” to TrueChoice’s HR Optimization experience. The request prioritized a visual redesign to the UI of the product we were pitching with, but I also wanted to ensure we add value for participants with these changes. The team and I took many iterative turns to reach a suitable solution because we were allowed to design <i>anything</i> that would, first, be visually striking in sales pitches to executive stakeholders and prospective customers, and secondly, be careful to avoid diluting the user experience or data granularity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The final proposal successfully offered a suite of eye-catching new changes that excited both existing and prospective customers while offering clear and valuable information to employees who participated in a study via the app. Due to the enhancements, our partners were more engaged in content development that benefited their participating employees.
        </p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Discovery: Embracing Change and Ambiguity</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/part1-grid.jpg" alt="Sketches for Part 1">
          <figcaption>Mid-fidelity Sketches for Part 1</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          To start framing the goals for this project, I organized a brainstorm to gather perspectives and ideas from our analytics and technology teams before pitching a general direction back to executive stakeholders. I limited the scope to Part 1 and Output ideas because they make up about 50% of the user journey and would have the highest impact. Designers used the discussion notes and general direction to explore different solutions that we continuously refined between each other.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            We agreed that successful changes would look discernibly different from the current HR applications UI and be perceived as more exciting to customers. We could gauge the feedback from our sales leads.
          </li>
          <li>
            We also agreed that “personalization” would best describe features that might improve each participant’s level of engagement and understanding in the app. This might be confirmed with a higher completion rate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, ideas for “conversational vibes” were less dependant on layout and other visual changes, so we asked our analytics team to help us modernize our copy and propose a standardized writing style.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Define, Ideate, Prototype: Assembling a Story</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/part1-samples.jpg" alt="Some chosen ideas for Part 1">
          <figcaption>Some chosen ideas for Part 1</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          Balancing the two goals for this project was difficult until I identified a connection that inspired the designers to focus their ideas around imagery and data-adjacent visuals. During the first week, I facilitated regular design team reviews and picked out ideas that connected with both goals. The chosen ideas were both visually interesting and more importantly, had the potential to improve each participant’s experience by converting their responses into visual data. Given the freedom and ambiguity, I periodically shared progress with the CEO which gave us the chance to improve our understanding of the goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the following week, the best ideas were combined and reassigned to designers to create wireframes and adapt ideas to a responsive layout. I also checked in with the rest of the technology team to ensure we can support a speedy implementation process when the designs were ready since a speedy implementation was another of the project’s requirements. <span class="highlight">The careful selection and assembly of individual ideas became our proposal for the new HR Optimization app user experience.</span>
        </p>
        <h4>The new look for Part 1</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/part1-focus.jpg" alt="Proposed Part 1 UI">
          <figcaption>Proposed Part 1 UI</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The iconography and slider handles were the most visually different. We felt this introduced to users a more direct way of interacting with and adjusting each option. The new dynamic graph background also serves as a visual representation of their preferences and another opportunity for designers to use color.
          </li>
          <li>
            We added color coding to the sliders and numerical value displays. Originally, we also replaced the numerical values with descriptive text but user testing showed confusion, and this idea was scrapped before final implementation. Another forethought with this change is the departure from sprite-based assets to CSS-based UI, which would improve browser performance and reduce steps in the build process.
          </li>
          <li>
            To set up “conversational vibes”, the larger image on the desktop layout fits a friendly face and also supports a “dynamic speech bubble” which can be used for words of encouragement after every few pages (Part 1 consists of 9 or more pages) or for “fun facts” relevant to the app’s subject matter.
          </li>
          <li>
            We also created an onboarding animation for the slider. This helped me convince our delivery team to be more comfortable with removing the redundant instructions from the pages.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Personalization Features in Output</h4>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/output.jpg" alt="Proposed HR Optimization Output">
          <figcaption>Proposed output layout and content i.e. “results page” for HR Optimization</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          When each participant completes the application, they are greeted with the output page. <span class="highlight">Compared to the original design, our new output page is more elaborate and surfaces relevant and useful actions according to each participant’s responses.</span> Similar to Part 1, we multiplied ideas from the discovery phase to elevate the level of personalization and create a more useful interactive page, rather than a static regurgitation of each participant’s answers.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/output-comparison.jpg" alt="Output UI comparison">
          <figcaption>Output UI comparison</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <ol>
          <li>
            At the top of the new layout, we added the ability to show more than 3 dynamically relevant messages (according to each participant’s preferences) and added buttons to each message. The new buttons are intended to encourage relevant action and we hope to see a higher engagement rate in future projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the bottom section of the new layout, we worked with the analytics team to add “bucketed preference groups” and new charts that gave participants more colorful insight into how their preferences compared to their coworkers. This feature was especially exciting to our partners as it offered new possibilities for displaying data to their users.
          </li>
          <li>
            We removed the static images which seldom matched the dynamic messages and caused confusion according to past client projects and user testing.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is also an option to save the output page as a PDF, allowing interested participants to download their results for later use. We can't expect our users to engage with the app for an extended period so we hope this would provide a useful option.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          To complete the list of enhancements, we went back to the delivery team to help establish a consistent writing style that was slightly more conversational and relaxed. We also removed any lingo or jargon specific to TrueChoice as all our expected users will be first-time participants.
        </p>
        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
        <p>
          Given the sheer amount of changes, I worked with our engineers to immediately set up a highly functional demo app for our end-to-end usability test. We felt that it was important to observe subtle reactions to the new microinteractions and thus reduced prototyping were less suitable. One of our senior designers ran remote usability tests for 5 testers and overall, the new features were effective! The responses, compared to previous tests, showed a greater interest in the topic presented by the application even when it was hypothetical. 
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Most testers reported liking the encouragement from Part 1’s dynamic speech bubble. They felt like they were being listened to.
          </li>
          <li>
            We must be careful of the wording to avoid accidentally saying that we are moving on to Part 2, such as “Excellent! Let’s move on to the next category.”
          </li>
          <li>
            Output features are communicative, and testers feel it’s more personalized when it recommends relevant next steps according to their preferences.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Revisiting</h3>
        <p>
          In the project’s 3-week span, since we decided to table some considerations to deliver a full suite of changes rather than complete individual features. We revisited the features which included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Designing for the use cases supported in the new output layout. For example, each message was designed to must include a CTA button but not every customer will be able to provide links for every message.
          </li>
          <li>
            Updating Part 2 and Part 3 sliders as CSS-based components. When we rebuilt Part 1 sliders with CSS, the designs no longer matched those still built with sprite assets.
          </li>
          <li>
            I also wrote and sketched new requirements with a developer to scale up the PDF printing feature. The original implementation required a developer to be on standby and configure the page based on the amount of content. The new implementation is print-friendly and removed the dependency.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For this project, I wanted to give my team a chance to work together but I received feedback that I made it more difficult when other responsibilities were shared equally. In subsequent projects, I have put fewer designers on a project with greater success. The remaining designers help by allowing the assigned designers to focus and they can still contribute by providing feedback.
        </p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          The suite of enhancements is used in all our sales pitch mockups and, after implementation, started use in client apps. We also received applause and excitement from our CEO, our organization partners, our sales team, and the customers signing on with us.
