        <h1>Kelvin K Lok. Designer. Manager.</h1>
        <p>
          Presently the Experience Strategy Lead for <a href="https://www.mastercard.com/global/en/business/large-enterprise/mastercard-commercial-solutions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mastercard Commercial Solutions</a>, where I help shape the future of our growing design organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have over a decade of experience as a product designer and five years as a team lead & manager. I have the pleasure of collaborating with talented people where my knack for <span class="highlight">digital interaction, user experience, creativity, and technology</span> help us deliver innovative and scalable solutions that add value to our&#160;customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          My favorite role utilizes my adaptive skill set to design accessible, responsive, and globally-deployed products, evangelize design thinking and research practices, recruit and mentor designers, and develop strategies to meet business and team&#160;objectives.
