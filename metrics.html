        <h2>Role</h2>
        <p>
          As the lead of a budding product team, I introduced and facilitated a series of standards, tools, and processes that became the foundation for a user-centric technology team on a traditionally visual-design-focused team.
        </p>

          <figcaption>We used to draw eye-candy like these in our free time and our data science team will not use them! (But that was totally our fault.)</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          At TrueChoice, we build web apps that quantify user preferences and allow us to share quantifiable and actionable insights with our customers. Up until 2014, the design process for each project was 2-3 weeks of drawing and pitching multiple design concepts that reinterpreted the client’s branding. Visual diversity was encouraged: UI components were moved around for each app and we drew “eye-candy” as a means to attract clients. This process also affected development, which was another 1-2 weeks.
        </p>
      </section>

        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>
          In 2014, when we started to transition the technology from Flash to HTML5, I took the opportunity to address scalability in our delivery process by establishing a standard UI template that followed usability heuristics. A standardized UI template would cut down the time each designer spent on coming up with new layouts for each project by separating product design from branding. This was a catalyst for more user-centric design processes, research, and user testing. A year later, we decreased the delivery process for each client from 4 weeks to a few days — and by 2020, to only a few hours. Instead of spending weeks on a single app, we spent only a day and used the rest of our time working on new products and innovations that could be used for every app. Driven by our new design values, the time saved was invested into identifying and solving problems for our users and helped move TrueChoice’s products forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rather than share one traditional project, each phase encapsulates a major achievement in my journey as a designer and UX leader at TrueChoice:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Phase 1: Establishing Fundamentals</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I evangelized a basic user-centric design process compiled of usability heuristics and research-backed decisions while designing the first iteration of the HTML5 app.
              </li>
              <li>
                I started usability tests with the internal team. In the early stage, this was enough to collect feedback and make further discoveries for improvement.
              </li>
              <li>
                I also started documentation and training processes to pass on our learnings to future designers. These fundamentals were adopted by the design team and used to design new features and products. After the HTML5 app was released, I leveraged my experience to <a href="./product-recommendation.html" target="_blank">redesign a product recommendation page</a> for TrueChoice's <i>Predictive Selling</i> app. I also guided the rest of the team when they designed new functionality.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phase 2: Tracking Metrics & Extending User Research</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I used existing metrics to push initiatives and track the successes of the features we were building. When I found gaps, I reached out to the development team to install new metrics. These reports were used to help gather executive buy-in on areas of improvement. I also worked with them to create internal tools like <i>Bowser</i> which visualize and communicate usage data.
              </li>
              <li>
                I reached out to our COO and CEO to set up a process and budget for usability testing outside of the company. I set up NDA forms before reaching out to “friends of the firm” for the first few rounds of testing, and then finally set up a budget for more testers who are key in ensuring regular tests. We documented our findings and held organization-wide debriefings summarizing the takeaways.
              </li>
              <li>
                During the 2020 pandemic, we started remote testing sessions. We hope to leave an archive of recordings for future designers and researchers at TrueChoice. 
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Phase 3: The Path Forward</b>
            <ol>
              <li>
                I started a fountain of resources for the team to pull from. The senior designers are able to help train their juniors, and we understand how to work across departments to develop meaningful changes to the product — by making new mistakes.
              </li>
              <li>
                As I continue to mature as a leader, I started working with our executive stakeholders to determine key strategic goals for the company. I help define and set the vision for TrueChoice’s product offerings: <i>Predictive HR, Predictive Selling</i>, and more.

        <h2>Phase 1: Establishing Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3>Practicing User-centric Design</h3>
        <p>
          My first iteration of the redesigned HTML5 application in 2014 applied usability heuristics that were already researched and established. I gathered research findings from <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neilsen Norman Group</a> and <a href="https://baymard.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Baymard Institute</a>, and best practices from web articles and books like Steve Krug's <i>Don't Make Me Think</i>. Apple and Google were also publishing <a href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UI guidelines</a> that we were able to borrow from.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also played through and reviewed many old Flash applications to get a count of high-frequency components and features to prioritize. We started a spreadsheet but it quickly became out of date so a talented developer created a reporting tool we coined “ASC” that automatically fetched how often components were used in all projects. It stood for “Application Statistics Catalog” and was pronounced like “ask” because if you need data, just ask!
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/platform-redlines.jpg" alt="The standard UI">
          <figcaption>Introducing the new UI template! Redline tools didn't exist at the time so this was all hand-drawn. 😭</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          With most of the user research was already done, I approached the recreation of the original Flash UI like a model kit where I was simply putting the pieces together. <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">From the research, we knew buttons and fonts had to be a certain size</a>. When setting the scope with the VP of Tech, we knew certain customizations and flairs like font families and animations were going to come later. Our prime focus was on usability and so the fun part was designing the responsive UI. None of the parts fit on the popular 320px wide iPhone and needed fresh ideas. (<i>Don't worry, Android fans, we also looked at and tested on non-Apple devices.</i>)
        </p>
        <h3>Rapid Prototyping and Internal Usability Testing</h3>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/team-unveiling.jpg" alt="Photo from the company unveiling and testing party">
          <figcaption>The company unveiling and testing party, with me in the top left! 🙋‍♂️</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          At first, we waited until after a beta version was developed before I could test it with teammates who did not directly work on the project. Part of the reason was to maintain a grand unveiling to build excitement within the organization. While we did receive a lot of excitement and praise, we learned that this was a mistake because this first iteration took us weeks to build and did not meet all the requirements of our analytics team. From then on, we interviewed representatives from each department for key requirements. The remaining modicum of secrecy was to maintain testers. I didn't understand until later but we didn't reach out to users because we weren't allowed direct access to the participants who use our app, nor testing candidates. After all, there were concerns about leaking sensitive IP.
        </p>

          <figcaption>Paper Prototype of Attributes rating and Product recommendation page</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          These rugged usability tests were excellent for collecting feedback and discovering opportunities for improvement, however, we were still working with developers to implement and I needed to get my ideas in front of people quicker. I introduced InVision as a way of converting wireframes for quick tests and demos. I also tried POP by Marvel as an even quicker way to turn paper drawings into a prototype. Very soon, rapid prototyping became an integral part of an iterative process that allowed us to make mistakes and validate faster. These techniques carried us for a few years as we continued to recreate TrueChoice's core offerings that were still left behind in Flash.

        <h2>Phase 2: Tracking Metrics & Extending User Research</h2>
        <h3>Adding Metrics</h3>
        <p>
          Continuing on the path of research-based design, we started to leverage metrics to track basic usage like time spent in each part of the application, device population, and how often each button was interacted with. In 2018, we recognized that about half of our users were on a mobile device and I managed a suite of improvements to key parts of the mobile experience. In 2019, when we were improving the mobile version of Part 2, my team and I defined metrics that would help us measure the level of engagement of the feature. <span class="highlight">Being able to see a 50% increase in engagements (or “moved sliders”) was a huge success for the mobile experience and to our capabilities as a product team.</span>
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/metrics-bowser-focus.jpg" alt="Engagement metrics in Bowser">
          <figcaption>Engagement metrics in “Bowser”. That's our mascot Labby in a Bowser cosplay as the logo.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          When the organization realized how valuable metrics were, I worked with the development team to make it easier to gather. Previously, we had to log into an outdated backend portal to fetch spreadsheets. I described the key data, tables, and visuals for the development team to create an internal tool we named <i>Bowser</i>. It periodically fetched and published data for each project in Dropbox. The spreadsheets were no more, and we could now easily visualize and communicate usage data for each app. Bowser continues to receive feature updates.
        </p>
        <h3>Extending User Research</h3>
        <p>
          By 2018, we have designed and redesigned our UI a few times but we didn't have a way to get feedback. The internal testing already grew beyond its usefulness. I proposed the value of external usability tests to our COO and CEO and was met with excitement and concern. We decided that I would prepare NDA forms to ensure the company's safety; I wrote something short and friendly that we could use. For the first few rounds of testing, we decided to only reach out to “friends of the firm”. This was a low-cost approach to try our ability to facilitate tests and provide meaningful insights. The COO even provided his family members as testers. It was nice to have the support and buy-in but I had my own list of testers.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/ux-business-risk.jpg" alt="UX Impact and Business Risk Quadrant">
          <figcaption>This quadrant gave examples of which features would signal a test</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          This quadrant served two purposes: (1) built trust & reduced friction with gaining approval for releases and (2) provided examples of “big features” that would require further validation. With the NDA forms, the approved list of testers, and this new understanding, we were ready to have our first usability test! (We also gained a level of trust with the c-suite and was closer to agile releases.)
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="./assets/19-12_Usability_Test.jpg" alt="Slide from the 2019 Usability Test Report">
          <figcaption>Slide from the 2019 Usability Test Report</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The first round of end-to-end tests in 2018 helped us gain a base understanding of how the application was received and where we might improve. The second round happened in 2019 after a set of UX enhancements. These were both held in person and we were not set up to record them. However, we diligently documented our findings and held an organization-wide debriefing summarizing the takeaways. For example, in the second round we discovered:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We had revamped the onboarding and instructions in the application and wanted to gauge the effectiveness. We found out that having multiple moving GIFs on a page made it distracting to read (this was a common request from our partners) and could now confidently communicate this issue while proposing an alternate solution.
          </li>
          <li>
            The instructional pages we added helped users understand the application better. In the first round, all testers guessed that there were 16 or so parts in the app. In the second, most correctly answered and described all 3 parts.
          </li>
          <li>
            We always knew our <i>Part 2</i> UI was confusing but now we finally had clues. This insight was valuable and very exciting since the challenge was left unsolved for over 10 years. We revised and validated this in 2021.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Following these successes, I was finally able to set up a larger budget for sourcing testers, ensuring regular tests.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
          This is an ongoing journey for TrueChoice's product team but some of our major wins include:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Reduced valuable time (re)designing and (re)building parts of the app that won't move the product forward.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provided a method of identifying user challenges. We can discover and prioritize new areas of opportunity and user pain points based on research and metrics.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gained stakeholder trust by building the product team’s credibility and ability to measure successes. In client relationships, we are asked to advise on usability.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Designers were no longer seen as visual artists and were given a seat to guide the future of the products.
